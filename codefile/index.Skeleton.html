<H1> State </H1>

State   = "c,r" where:

SkeletonWorld.ACTION_LEFT
(move left)

<li> SkeletonWorld.ACTION_RIGHT
(move right)

<H1> Score </H1>

Score = "s1,s2" where:
<ul>
<li>  s1 = number of times robber was caught (primary score)
<li>  s2 = number of times robber was caught due to our action, not robber's action (secondary score)
</ul>
